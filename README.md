Thus comes with a instant messaging server and a instant messaging client
The networking module in this code is the module that offers both low-level networking
functionality, such as TCP and UDP sockets, as well as high-level networking classes for
web integration and network communication.
In this code i use the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) internet protocol for
the program instead of the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) protocol. The main difference is
that TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that requires all clients to establish a connection
to the server before they are able to communicate with each other.![qt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81354428/167534640-7d69d5e6-9b33-4669-9dd7-a291175fba43.PNG)
